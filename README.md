## CCJS 450 (0301) - Advanced Juvenile Delinquency (Spring 2024)

### Course Syllabus

* Course description (from the University catalog) -- Examination of juvenile delinquency in the United States. Nature and extent of juvenile delinquency, historical approaches, sociological and criminological theories and research, social contexts including the institutions of families, schools, and peers, and social responses. Prevention, punishment, and treatment programs, both within and outside of the juvenile justice and criminal justice systems.
* Meetings -- This course is scheduled to meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9:30-10:45am in Tydings 1132 and I plan to hold office hours on Tuesdays from 1-2:30pm and by appointment (you can email me at rbrame@umd.edu). If you need to email me, please refrain from using the ELMS messaging system and send your message directly to my email address. My office is 2139 LeFrak Hall.
* Course-related policies -- In all matters, I will follow University guidance as outlined [here](https://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html).
* Accessibility accommodations: As a matter of University policy, I do my best to abide by all recommended accommodations. If you think you might need one or more academic accommodations, please contact the Accessibility and Disability Service Office ([link](https://ads.umd.edu)) for guidance and assistance.
* Book: Puzzanchera, Hockenberry, and Sickmund (Hereafter PHS; 2022). *Youth and the Juvenile Justice System* (2022). Washington DC: Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP; [link](https://ojjdp.ojp.gov/library/publications/youth-and-juvenile-justice-system-2022-national-report)). *Note* you will not be responsible for reading this whole book. I will assign certain sections for you to read as we go along. The book may be helpful to you as you consider your research project so I encourage you to look at the range of topics covered as you develop your idea. There will also be some additional readings assigned as we go.
* Class Notes -- the class notes and links to assigned readings will be posted on this webpage.
* Letter grades -- At the end of the semester, letter grades will be assigned on a 100-point scale (A = 90 and higher; B = 80-89; C = 70-79; D = 60-69; and F = any grade less than 60). All numeric grades (including the final numeric grade in the class at the end of the semester) will be rounded off to the nearest 1 point (i.e,. a 78.7 would be rounded to a 79). Note that plus/minus grading is not used in this course.
* Numeric grades in this class will be based on 3 exams and a research project. All numeric grades will be based on a 100-point scale. The first 2 exams will each count 25% weight toward your final grade; the final exam will count 30% weight as it will cover slightly more material (and you will have more time to work on it). The research project will count 20% weight (Final Grade = 0.25 x Exam 1 + 0.25 x Exam 2 + 0.3 x Final Exam + 0.2 x Research Project). The final exam is not cumulative.
* Key dates -- (1) first class day - Thursday 1/25; (2) spring break - 3/19-3/21; (3) paper due date - Thursday 5/2; (4) last day of class - Thursday 5/9; and (5) scheduled final exam period - Monday May 13th, 8-10am.
* Attendance expectations -- My expectation is that you will attend all class sessions (unless you are sick or have some other good reason not to attend). If you have to miss a class, I encourage you to work with other people in the class to get caught up on your notes. You are welcome to meet with me to get clarification on any material you missed or don't understand. If you have to miss an exam, we will follow the notification and make-up policies specified by the University.
* Exams -- will be a combination of multiple choice, true/false, and short answer questions (1-3 sentence answers). About 1/2 of the points on each exam will come from the multiple choice and true/false questions; the other 1/2 will come from the short answer questions. There will be review time in the class period before each exam. Exams are in-class, pen-and-paper closed-book format; no computers or other electronic devices, books, or notes on the exams. You will write directly on the exams so you don't need to buy exam books. You will encounter many statistics in this course but I will not ask you to recall a specific statistic on an exam. You are asked to be familiar with facts, themes, patterns, and significant scientific findings but this will not be an exercise in memorizing specific numbers. When you are studying for exams, I recommend that you: (1) overweight materials that have been discussed in class; and (2)  underweight materials that are in the readings that are not also discussed in class (note that the word underweight does not mean zero weight). As noted above, the final exam is not cumulative.
* Learning outcomes -- At the end of this course you should be able to describe and analyze: (1) the history of the legal status and legal treatment of children and adolescents; (2) problems related to the measurement of crime and delinquency; and (3) a series of significant research studies related to juvenile delinquency or juvenile justice. Finally, you will demonstrate your ability to conduct your own research study where you test a specific hypothesis with real data. After you have completed this project, you should be able to clearly describe your question, what you learned, and the strengths and weaknesses of your approach.

#### Research Project Development and Milestones

* You will identify a research question (and a preliminary theoretical justification for it) that is answerable with existing and publicly available data. Your justification should include appropriate citations to extant literature. Think about a juvenile delinquency or juvenile justice question that interests you; feel free to discuss this with me before you commit to a topic.
* You will *not* be collecting any new data for this project.
* You should submit your proposed question to me for approval by end of the day on ELMS on Friday February 16th.
* You should submit a description of the publicly available data you will use accompanied by a website or link so I can review it; this is due on ELMS by end of the day on Friday March 1st.
* You should submit a rough draft of your project including a fully developed theoretical justification for your question and a description of your data, methods, and findings by end of the day on 3/31.
* Final drafts are due by end of the day on Friday 4/26; 3 point penalty for each hour the project is late.
* *Note*: only the final papers are graded. These intermediate reviews will be for giving you comments and guidance to help you develop a high quality project. You should note that late submissions will not be marked -- with the exception of the final graded paper which will be marked down 3 points for every hour the submission is late.

#### Research Project Grading Rubric

Each of the following elements will count 10% toward the project grade:

* paper is submitted with correct APA format (example APA formatted paper at this webpage [link](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/paper-format/student-annotated.pdf)) in pdf format (automatic 5-point deduction if not in pdf format).
* minimal grammatical and spelling errors.
* clearly defined research question related to juvenile delinquency or juvenile justice.
* question is motivated by appropriate research literature (3 or more external references required).
* publicly available data set is fully described and properly documented; research results can be reproduced.
* data set is well matched to the question.
* appropriate analysis methods used to address question.
* clearly stated conclusions.
* even-handed assessment of study strengths and weaknesses.
* 5-7 page document including tables/figures/references (note: tables, figures, and references should not be more than 2 pages of the document); 3 point penalty for each hour the project is late.

#### Course Outline
